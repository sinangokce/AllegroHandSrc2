allegro-hand unofficial fork
============================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/felixduvallet/allegro-hand-ros.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/felixduvallet/allegro-hand-ros)

ss

This is an unofficial fork of SimLab's allegro [hand ros package][1].

[1]: https://github.com/simlabrobotics/allegro_hand_ros

It improves significantly upon the SimLab version by providing a catkin-ized
version, simplifies the launch file structure, updates the package/node names to
have a more consistent structure, improves the build process by creating a
common driver, introduces an AllegroNode C++ class that reduces the amount of
duplicated code. It also provides a python library that can control the hand
directly.

It also provides the BHand library directly in this package (including both
32-bit and 64-bit versions, though 32-bit systems will need to update the
symlink manually).

At this point no effort has been made to be backwards compatible.

Launch file instructions:
------------------------

There is a single file to start any hand,
[allegro_hand.launch](allegro_hand/launch/allegro_hand.launch)
that starts the hand. It takes many arguments, but at a minimum you must specify
the handedness:

    roslaunch allegro_hand allegro_hand.launch HAND:=right

You can also simulate the hand very easily:

    roslaunch allegro_hand allegro_hand.launch HAND:=right CONTROLLER:=sim

Optional (recommended) arguments:

          NUM:=0|1|...
          ZEROS:=/path/to/zeros_file.yaml
          CONTROLLER:=grasp|pd|velsat|torque|sim
          RESPAWN:=true|false   Respawn controller if it dies.
          KEYBOARD:=true|false  (default is true)
          AUTO_CAN:=true|false  (default is true)
          CAN_DEVICE:=/dev/pcanusb1 | /dev/pcanusbNNN  (ls -l /dev/pcan* to see open CAN devices)
          VISUALIZE:=true|false  (Launch rviz)
          JSP_GUI:=true|false  (show the joint_state_publisher for *desired* joint angles)

Note on `AUTO_CAN`: There is a nice script `detect_pcan.py` which automatically
finds an open `/dev/pcanusb` file. If instead you specify the can device
manually (`CAN_DEVICE:=/dev/pcanusbN`), make sure you *also* specify
`AUTO_CAN:=false`. Obviously, automatic detection cannot work with two hands.

The second launch file is for visualization, it is included in
`allegro_hand.launch` if `VISUALIZE:=true`. Otherwise, it can be useful to run
it separately (with `VISUALIZE:=false`), for example if you want to start rviz separately
(and keep it running):

    roslaunch allegro_hand allegro_viz.launch HAND:=right

Note that you should also specify the hand `NUM` parameter in the viz launch if
the hand number is not zero.

Packages
--------

 * **allegro_hand** A python client that enables direct control of the hand in
                    python code, and all generic launch files.
 * **allegro_hand_driver** Driver for talking with the allegro hand.
 * **allegro_hand_controllers** Different nodes that actually control the hand.
 The AllegroNode class handles all the generic driver comms, each class then
 implements `computeDesiredTorque` differently (and can have various topic
 subscribers):
   * grasp: Apply various pre-defined grasps, including gravity compensation.
   * pd: Joint space control: save and hold positions.
   * velsat: velocity saturation joint space control (supposedly experimental)
   * torque: Direct torque control.
   * sim: Just pass desired joint states through as current joint states.
 * **allegro_hand_description** xacro descriptions for the kinematics of the
     hand, rviz configuration and meshes.
 * **allegro_hand_keyboard** Node that sends the commanded grasps. All commands
     are available with the grasp controller, only some are available with the
     other controllers.
 * **allegro_hand_parameters** All necessary parameters for loading the hand:
   * gains_pd.yaml: Controller gains for PD controller.
   * gains_velSat.yaml: Controller gains and parameters for velocity saturation
           controller.
   * initial_position.yaml: Home position for the hand.
   * zero.yaml: Offset and servo directions for each of the 16 joints, and some
           meta information about the hand.
   * zero_files/ Zero files for all hands.
 * **bhand** Library files for the predefined grasps, available in 32 and 64 bit
     versions. 64 bit by default, update symlink for 32 bit.

Note on polling (from SimLabs): The preferred sampling method is utilizing the
Hand's own real time clock running @ 333Hz by polling the CAN communication
(polling = true, default). In fact, ROS's interrupt/sleep combination might
cause instability in CAN communication resulting unstable hand motions.

Installing the PCAN driver
--------------------------

Before using the hand, you must install the pcan drivers. This assumes you have
a peak-systems pcan to usb adapter.

1. Install these packages

    sudo apt-get install libpopt-dev ros-indigo-libpcan

2. Download latest drivers: http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/linux/index.htm#download

Install the drivers:

    make clean; make NET=NO_NETDEV_SUPPORT
    sudo make install
    sudo /sbin/modprobe pcan

Test that the interface is installed properly with:

     cat /proc/pcan

You should see some stuff streaming.

When the hand is connected, you should see pcanusb0 or pcanusb1 in the list of
available interfaces:

    ls -l /dev/pcan*

If you do not see any available files, you may need to run:

    sudo ./driver/pcan_make_devices 2

from the downloaded pcan folder: this theoretically creates the devices files if
the system has not done it automatically.


Gazebo alpha support
--------------------

Gazebo is supported in theory, thanks to inertial parameters from @trhermans.
However, I have not been successful at running a physical simulation of the robot hand.
I am leaving the gazebo option for others to experiment; to try it out, pass GAZEBO:=true to the launch file.

Contributions (pull requests) to fix the simulation are welcome.
